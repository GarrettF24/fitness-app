## Project Name

fitness-app

## Project Description

The fitness-app is a simple tool to help users with staying motivated with their fitness routines. One of the worst things a person  can do when going to the gym is going without a plan. The fitness-app is a mobile friendly, easy to use way to plan out your workout for the day or week. A history section will be available to show your progress plus upcoming workouts. The history section will also be good for when users are seeking inspiration and wish to switch up their routines a bit.

|Agu 23| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Aug 24| Finish MVP  | Incomplete
|July 16| Finalize Styling, Test App| Incomplete
|July 17| Presentations | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
